      "* 2 cups of light malt extract\n",
      "* 2 cups of Pilsner malt\n",
      "* 1 cup of Munich malt\n",
      "* 1 oz of Hallertau hops (60 min.)\n",
      "* 1 oz of Saaz hops (5 min.)\n",
      "* Yeast (Wyeast 2124, or another lager yeast)\n",
      "Instructions:\n",
      "1. Heat the water to 160°F (71°C) and hold it at that temperature for 15 minutes.\n",
      "2. Steep the malt extract in the hot water for 15 minutes.\n",
      "3. Add the Pilsner malt, Munich malt, and Hallertau hops to the mash tun and mix well.\n",
      "4. Sparge the grain with 160°F (71°C) water to collect the wort.\n",
      "5. Bring the wort to a boil and add the Saaz hops at the end of the boil.\n",
      "6. Cool the wort to fermentation temperature (around 55°F/13°C) and pitch the yeast.\n",
      "7. Ferment the beer at room temperature (around 70°F/21°C) for 7-10 days.\n",
      "8. Transfer the beer to a secondary fermenter and let it age for 2-4 weeks.\n",
      "9. Bottle or keg the beer and carbonate to around 2.5 volumes of CO2.\n",
      "10. Enjoy your delicious homemade lager!\n",
      "Note: This recipe is just a basic guideline, and you can adjust the ingredients and brewing process to suit your preferences. Also, make sure to use a hydrometer to measure the specific gravity of the wort and calculate the alcohol content of the beer.\n",

    "An internal combustion engine (ICE or IC engine) is a heat engine in which the combustion of a fuel occurs with an oxidizer (usually air) in a combustion chamber that is an integral part of the working fluid flow circuit. In an internal combustion engine, the expansion of the high-temperature and high-pressure gases produced by combustion applies direct force to some component of the engine. The force is typically applied to pistons (piston engine), turbine blades (gas turbine), a rotor (Wankel engine), or a nozzle (jet engine). This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into kinetic energy which is used to propel, move or power whatever the engine is attached to.\n",
